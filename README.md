# HVAC Anomaly Detection using Time Series Forecasting

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) data using time series analysis with Facebook Prophet. The goal is to identify unexpected spikes or drops in energy consumption, which could indicate equipment faults, energy inefficiencies, or external interferences.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Energy consumption logs from HVAC systems over time.
- **Objective**: Detect anomalies by modeling the normal behavior of the system.
- **Approach**: 
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Time series forecasting using Prophet
  - Anomaly detection based on residuals (forecast vs. actual)
  - Visualizing anomalies
